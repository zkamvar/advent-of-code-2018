# advent-of-code-2018

my own personal challenge for the advent of code.

I plan to complete the advent of code using only base R. Each day will be stored
in a separate folder labeled `dxx`. All scripts will be named `zkamvar.R` and
all input data will be named `zkamvar-input.R`. 

I will additionally be posting the text of the challenge at the beginning of the
scripts so that I can solve them offline

All of the scripts are runnable via Rscript like so:

```r
Rscript zkamvar.r zkamvar-input.txt
```
